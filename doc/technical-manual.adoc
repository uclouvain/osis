This documentation explains how to contribute as a committer to OSIS project. A committer is an individual who is disciplined enough to gain the confidence of the project manager to commit directly to the repository without further bureaucracy. In fact, be accepted as a committer is a great recognition of the quality of your work as a programmer.

== Installing OSIS

The first thing to do to start contributing to the project is to prepare the development environment. During this section, we explain in details how to do that in a Debian-based distribution (Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.). This is the recommended operating system for development and deployment.

Since we are going to install many things using the `apt-get` command, let's update the package lists from remote repositories first:

    $ sudo apt-get update

This command gets information about the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. This way, we make sure we are getting the latest version of whatever we need to install.

If your operating system is not based on Debian Linux then you can rely on a virtual machine as a development environment. For the virtual machine, we suggest  https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox] as virtual runtime and https://ubuntu-mate.org[Ubuntu Mate] as operating system. Follow the installation instructions on their respective websites according to your own platform. When the Ubuntu virtual machine is created and running, execute the following command to make the operating system aware of the virtual runtime:

    $ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11

Now that you have a Debian-based Linux system available, you can start preparing the development environment in it. Follow the steps below:

- <<installing-git>>
- <<installing-postgresql>>
- <<installing-django>>
- <<installing-application>>

[[installing-git]]
=== Installing and Configuring Git

Git is a distributed version control system used to manage the source code of OSIS. The source code is necessary to develop and deploy OSIS and we start the instructions by explaining how to install and configure it. We can use `apt-get` to install Git:

    $ sudo apt-get install git

Next, we add some personal information in the local Git installation to make sure you are well identified in all commits:

    $ git config --global user.name "[Firstname] [Lastname]"
    $ git config --global user.email "[firstname.lastname]@domain.com"

Since version 2.0, Git has adopted a new behavior to pull and push commits while in a branch. When you execute `git push` or `git pull` Git will consider pushing or pulling just for the current branch. Before, these commands would push and pull all branches. But the change to this new behavior is voluntary, not automatically imposed. So, we have to explicitly say we have to move from the old behavior to the new one. To do that, execute the following command:

    $ git config --global push.default simple

=== Configuring Git to Simplify GitHub Authentication

For the moment, every time we push code to GitHub the prompt asks for a username and password. We can bypass this step by registering a SSH key. To do that, we first check whether there is already an existing SSH key we can reuse:

    $ ls -al ~/.ssh

If files with the extension `.pub` are listed then one of them can be reused to authenticate to GitHub. If not, then we can create one:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[firstname.lastname]@domain.com"
      Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
      Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

The next step is to add the new key - or an existing one - to the `ssh-agent`. This program runs the duration of a local login session, stores unencrypted keys in memory, and communicates with SSH clients using a Unix domain socket. Everyone who is able to connect to this socket also has access to the ssh-agent. First, we have to enable the ssh-agent:

    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

And add key to it:

    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

The next step is to make GitHub aware of the key. For that, we have to copy the exact content of the file `id_rsa.pub` and paste into GitHub. To make no mistake about the copy, install a program called `xclip`:

    $ sudo apt-get install xclip

And then copy the content of the file `id_rsa.pub` in the clipboard:

    $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

The command above is the equivalent of opening the file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, selecting the whole content and pressing `Ctrl+C`. This way, you can paste the content on GitHub when required in the next steps. On the GitHub side:

 . Login at https://github.com
 . In the top right corner of the page, click on the profile photo and select
   **Settings**
 . In the user settings sidebar, click **SSH keys**
 . Then click **Add SSH key**
 . In the form, define a friendly title for the new key and paste the key in the
   **Key** field
 . Click **Add Key** to finish with GitHub

To make sure everything is working, lets test the connection:

    $ ssh -T git@github.com
      The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
      RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
      _
      Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
      provide shell access.

We can test the installation by cloning the OSIS repository:

    $ mkdir -p ~/python/projects/osis
    $ cd ~/python/projects/osis
    $ git clone git@github.com:uclouvain/osis.git
    
The source code has some submodules that have to be cloned as well:

    $ cd osis
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

This configuration works only when we use a ssh connection to GitHub. To verify that, go to one of your local GitHub projects and check the url pointing to the server:

    $ cd ~/python/projects/osis/osis
    $ git remote -v

If the url starts with `https://` then you are using `https` instead of `ssh`. In this case, you should change the url to the ssh one:

    $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:uclouvain/osis.git

The automatic authentication should work after that.

[[installing-postgresql]]
=== Installing and Configuring PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the only database supported by OSIS. In theory, the Django ORM would make the application database-independent, but we do not test OSIS with other databases, thus we cannot guarantee that it works on other databases such as MySQL or Oracle. Fortunately, PostgreSQL has a very good reputation, a large community and a generous documentation.

TIP: If you really need a database different from PostgreSQL then you could contribute to the project by testing OSIS on your favorite database.

Execute the following commands to install PostgreSQL:

    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql
    $ sudo su - postgres -c "createuser -s $USER"
    $ sudo apt-get install python3
    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

The first command installs PostgreSQL and creates a user named after the current logged OS user. The libraries python3-dev and libpq-dev are also installed for development purposes.

=== Creating the Database

Before moving forward, make sure you installed PostgreSQL, as explained in the section <<installing-postgresql>>. Then, follow the steps below to create the backend database:

    $ createdb osis_local
    $ createuser osis -P    // Inform the password 'osis' when asked for.
    $ psql -d osis_local
      =# grant connect on database osis_local to osis;
      =# revoke connect on database osis_local from public;
      =# alter user osis createdb;
      =# \q

[[installing-django]]

=== Installing PostgreSQL extensions ('unaccent' case)

Some project submodules require specific extensions (e.g. 'unaccent'). In order to enable an extension, add it to the database with the following command:

    $ psql -d osis_local -c 'create extension unaccent;'   

If you encounter problems occuring with the specific extensions in your tests, you might need to enable this extension on the database template (used by PostgreSQL for building a new db from scratch) with the following command:

    $ psql -d template1 -c 'create extension unaccent;'

If you are usually launching tests with --keep-db (-k) parameter, do not forget to remove it temporarily in order to regenerate the test db.

=== Installing GeoDjango libraries

The project uses https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/[GeoDjango]. The libraries needed to make work GeoDjango can be installed via the following command:

    $ sudo apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin

A migration file already create the "postgis" extension for the database.

IMPORTANT: The database user must have superuser in order to execute the migration file.

=== Installing and Configuring Django

Django is a modern and lightweight web framework to support our back office and front office applications. The choice for Django was made thanks to the following advantages:

- Very well documented.
- The most popular web framework on the Python ecosystem. Largely supported by
  the majority of platforms, IDEs and web servers in general.
- It supports several databases: Oracle, PortgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
- Most of the time, modifications in the code can be immediately seen on the
  browser, without the need for redeployments or restarts.
- Easily testable with Selenium.
- In general, more productive than most of the alternatives.

The repository `uclouvain/osis` is a Django application. We already cloned that when <<installing-git>>. Now, we move forward installing the Python virtual environment and other system dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-venv libjpeg-dev libpng-dev gettext

In the new repository, create a virtual environment to isolate all dependencies of the project:

    $ cd ~/python/projects/osis/osis
    $ python3 -m venv venv

[[installing-application]]
=== Installing the Application

Start the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

    $ cp .env.example .env

The `.env` file makes it simple to manage environment variables, but it already contains all the necessary values for development purpose. Therefore, it doesn't need to be changed, unless you are installing OSIS in other environments.

Create the data structure in the database:

    (venv)$ python manage.py migrate

To create the super user:

    (venv)$ python manage.py createsuperuser
       Username (leave blank to use '[linux-user]'):
       Email address: your@emailaddress.com
       Password:
       Password (again):
       Superuser created successfully.

You will need this user to login on OSIS for the first time and be able to create other users.

Optionally, you can load the demonstration data to have some basis for development and testing:

    (venv)$ python manage.py load_fixtures

Before running the application we have a last step to do, which is compiling the translation files:

    (venv)$ python manage.py compilemessages

Now, we can run the application:

    (venv)$ python manage.py runserver

You can leave the server running while you are developing. It will take into account all changes in your code, except the changes in the model. In this case, we have to stop the server to execute the commands `makemigrations` and `migrate` as shown above. When we have finished your daily work, we can deactivate the virtual environment:

    (venv)$ deactivate

== Contributing to the Project

[[installing-pycharm]]
=== Installing PyCharm IDE

As the codebase grows and becomes more complex to navigate we face more issues with light weight Python editors. We decided to try out several tools in the project and we came to the conclusion that https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/[PyCharm] is the best Python IDE for our needs.

We would like to ask all contributors to use PyCharm - at least the community edition - to contribute to OSIS because it has a very good https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/[PEP 8] code verification, auto completion, navigation and debugging, saving a lot of time in the process of pull requests evaluations.

Please, follow the instructions on https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/[PyCharm's website] to install the IDE on your operating system.

=== Configuration of PyCharm to contribute to OSIS

==== Configuring the Python Interpreter

1. Open OSIS project.
2. Select `File -> Settings -> Project:osis -> Project Interpreter`
3. Click on the wheel on the top right , and choose `add Local`
4. Navigate to the python3.4 binary in your virtual environment (`VENV/bin/python3.4`)

image::images/pycharm_osis_config_1.png[Pycharm Python Interpreter Config]

==== Configuring PyCharm to Debug the Project

1. Click on the drop down list at the top right of the ide , and choose `Edit Configuration` .
2. Click on the `+` button and add a python script.
3. Fill in the name.
4. In the `Script` field, choose the manage.py script in the root folder of OSIS.
5. In the `Script parameters` field, add `runserver` .
6. Apply and Ok.
7. To launch the server in debug mode, click on the bug in the right corner.

image::images/pycharm_osis_config_2.png[Pycharm Debug Config]

[NOTE]
====
Running the application outputs an error :

    django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.

This error is not present while debugging.
====

==== Internationalization

OSIS follow the same approach as for the internationalization described in Django project (I180N).
In some areas, we have adopted  more strict rules:

- Use of %()s format is the default standard adopted.

    # Bad
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "Hello {name}"
    msgstr "Salut {name}"

    # Good
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "Hello %(name)s"
    msgstr "Salut %(name)s"

- Keywords msgid is now forbidden ! (Previously, it was the standard adopted in OSIS)

    # Bad
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "hello_world"
    msgstr "Salut le monde!"

    # Good
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "Hello world!"
    msgstr "Salut le monde!"

- Case differences between msgid/msgstr is not allowed

    # Bad
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "HellO"
    msgstr "bonjour"

    # Good
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "Hello"
    msgstr "Salut"

- Translation without named parameters is not allowed

    # Bad
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "Hello %s"
    msgstr "Salut %s"

    # Good
    locale/fr_BE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    msgid "Hello %(name)s"
    msgstr "Salut %(name)s"

- `.po` file must be generated with `./manage.py makemessages` and sorted by alphabetical order (`--sort-output` option)


Only `.po` files are committed to the repository. `.mo` files are ignored in the `.gitignore` file.

[NOTE]
====
Don't use the u prefixing of gettext

    The u prefixing of gettext functions was originally to distinguish usage between unicode strings and bytestrings on Python 2. For code that supports only Python 3, they can be used interchangeably. A deprecation for the prefixed functions may happen in a future Django release.

OSIS only support Python 3
====

=== Following the Git Workflow

The code repository is organized in three fixed branches:

- *dev*: agregates developers' contributions that are intended to be in production, but they still need to be validated.
- *qa*: at the end of the sprint, when all features are frozen, the branch `dev` is merged into `qa` to allow testers to validate the release before it gets into production.
- *master*: once the version in `qa` is fully validated, it is merged into the branch `master`, which is the one to be deployed in production.

Developers should not commit directly to any of these branches. By convention, these branches can only be changed if there is an issue in the https://github.com/uclouvain/osis/issues[issue tracking tool] that justifies the creation of an exclusive branch for that issue. For instance: if the issue's number is `#234` then its respective branch is named `issue#234`, created to isolate the changes described in the issue. To create a new branch for the issue, perform the following commands:

    $ git checkout dev
    $ git pull origin dev
    $ git checkout -b issue#234

The first command enters in the branch `dev`, if the developer is not already in there. Within the branch `dev`, the latest commits in the remote branch `origin/dev` are downloaded and merged within the local branch `dev`. Then, the new branch `issue#234` is created from the local branch `dev`.

The developer in charge of the issue `#234` changes the code within the branch `issue#234`. Two commands are very useful to keep track of what has been done:

    $ git status
    $ git diff models.py

The first command shows all created, modified, removed and untracked files that are candidates to be committed. The second shows the changes in one of the modified files. When we are ready to commit, we should decide whether all changed files will be included in the commit or just a subset of them. To
include all files:

    $ git commit -a -m "New entities added."

To include a subset of files, we have to add each file individually:

    $ git add base/models/academic_year.py
    $ git add base/models/academic_calendar.py
    $ git add base/models/__init__.py
    $ git commit -m "New entities added."

image::images/git-state-diagram.png[Git State Diagram]

=== Creating and Working in a Branch

The issue tracker generates an incremental id that we can use to name branches. It helps to keep branches linked to issues. For example: considering an issue with the id 260, we can create a local branch with the following commands:

    $ git fetch origin dev
    $ git checkout dev
    $ git checkout -b issue#260

The first command updates the branch `dev` with the last changes on the server. The second command moves from the branch we are at the moment to the branch `dev`. The last command creates the branch `issue#260` from `dev` and immediately moves to it. From this moment, every commit will be attached to the correct branch. If the branch `dev` already exists in local, then instead of fetching it we should pull it:

    $ git pull origin dev

Committing often is encouraged. All commits are done locally, thus there is no risk of conflicts until all commits are sent to the server. The `push` option sends all commits in a local branch to the server, identified by `origin`.

    $ git push origin issue#260

==== Fixing Mistakes

Version control doesn‚Äôt always happens smoothly. We will certainly face some problems and fortunately Git is very gentile on which concerns recovering from mistakes. These are some common situations we may face during development.

===== Moving to another branch before finishing the work in the current branch

Sometimes we are working in a branch and a more urgent problem arrives, requiring us to move to or create another branch. In this case, we have to commit all changes in the current branch before moving to another one, otherwise we risk to have our changes to the current branch committed in another branch.
So, first add your changes and commit:

    $ git commit -a -m "New entities added but still incomplete."

and then move to an existing branch:

    $ git checkout issue#261

or create another branch from `dev`:

    $ git checkout dev
    $ git checkout -b issue#261

It also happens that we start fixing an issue but we forget to move to its respective branch. In this case, we have to commit the files related to the current branch and leave in the workspace the changes related to another branch:

    $ git add calendar.py
    $ git commit -m "Sort algorithm started."
    $ git checkout issue#260

The files that were not committed in the previous branch will be available for commit in the branch issue#260.

This practical approach of moving from a branch to another while leaving some files uncommitted may not work if at least one of the files we have changed locally was also changed remotely. We may see a message like this:

    From https://github.com/uclouvain/osis
    * branch            dev        -> FETCH_HEAD
    Updating 57c4a6d..9839a25
    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten
           by merge:
           __openerp__.py
    Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
    Aborting

In this case, we have to commit local changes before moving to another branch. But things can get worse because the current branch might be actually related to a closed issue, thus committing to it doesn't make sense anymore. In this case, we can use `git stash`. It moves all changes in the current workspace to a transit area that can be recovered later on. To move all changes to the stash area, simply type :

    $ git stash

Now, if we type `git status` we find the working directory clean, which means we can move to another branch. To see the stashes we have stored we can use:

    $ git stash list

After moving to another branch, we can recover the changes from the stash are using:

    $ git stash apply

but if there is more than one stash in the list we can apply a specific one by referencing its identifier:

    $ git stash apply stash@{2}

===== Reverting commits

To revert the changes made in the last 4 commits and create a new commit with the reverted changes:

    $ git revert HEAD~3

To revert the changes made between the fifth and the third (included) last commits in the branch `master`, but not creating any commit for the reverted changes:

    $ git revert -n master~5..master~2

This revert only modifies the working tree and the index.

To revert a sequence of commits using haches:

    $ git revert --no-edit ffffffff..12345678

It applies reversed parches to the working directory in sequence, working backwards to the known good commit. With the `--no-edit` flag, the changes to the working directory are automatically committed after each reversed patch is applied.

===== DANGER ZONE

In extreme cases, when on one has pushed to the target branch since the bad pushes or the remote branch is empty, then a `non-fast-forward` commit can be performed:

    $ git reset --hard <last_good_commit>
    $ git push --force

It leaves the reflog intact locally and in the remote branch. The bad commits may disappear from the history and don't propagate further.

== Fixing the latest commit message

    $ git commit --amend -m "message"

When we work with branches it‚Äôs very common to fool with the commits. There are many branches locally and sometimes we forget to switch to the branch related to the issue and we end up committing on the wrong branch. When it happens before pushing the commits to the server, we can undo the last commit done with the command:

    $ git reset --soft HEAD~1

But if the commit was already pushed to the server, it is still possible to undo the push as long as other people have not pushed to the same branch after the wrong push. It is done with the following command:

    $ git push origin master -f

Stop tracking a file without deleting it locally:

    $ git rm --cached [file]

Deleting remote branches:

    $ git push origin --delete test

= Tests

== Automated Tests

=== Testing The User Interface Using Selenium

Selenium relies on HTML elements' ids to identify and interact with user interface elements. In other words, if an element doesn't have an id then Selenium cannot reference it in its test scripts. Therefore, it is important that every element the user interacts directly - such as text fields, links or buttons - must have an id.

The amount of ids to be defined in a single page is not negligible. Since ids must not repeat in the same page, at some point we will lack creativity to think about more unique values to identify the elements. To help with this, we have defined a list of prefixes, one for each type of element, listed in the table below:

|===
|Prefix|Element Type |Prefix|Element Type |Prefix|Element Type

|bt_
|Button
|pnl_
|Div
|tab_
|Tab

|chb_
|Checkbox
|rdb_
|Radio button
|txa_
|Text area

|fil_
|File field
|lnk_
|Link
|txt_
|Text field

|form_
|Form
|num_
|Numeric field
|
|

|hdn_
|Hidden field
|slt_
|Combobox
|
|
|===

Some examples of use:

    <!-- Text field -->
    <input type="text" id="txt_start_date">

    <!-- Hidden field -->
    <input type="hidden" id="hdn_academic_calendar">

    <!-- Combobox field -->
    <select id="slt_academic_year">

=== Launch tests locally
[NOTE]
====
To run tests, the db_user must be granted with CREATEDB permission.

Close Firefox

==== Launch tests
    (venv)$ python launch_tests.py -t selenium

== Adding the license to the source code

OSIS is an open source project licensed under GPL v3. As such, it must respect certain rules of the license. The most important one is the addition of a license header in each one of the source files.

For Python files, the following text should appear on the top of the file, before any Python code:
